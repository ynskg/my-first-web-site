  <h2><p>css</h2>
    <strong><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp" target="_blank" title="css instruction">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a></strong> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
    written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
    <p>CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
    <p>This separation can improve content accessibility;
    provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;
    enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,
    which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .
    css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
